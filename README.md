This is a responsive portfolio made using Bootstrap 4, CSS, and HTML only. This was a good practice in order to understand rows and columns better in bootstrap. I added a lot of shadows and border-radius because I like the way
it looks mostly. Some components from Bootstrap are modified using the grid system and added in semantics instead of divs. Thanks for reading this and any feedback would love to hear. Cheers.
